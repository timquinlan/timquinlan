- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @timquinlan, a creative field engineer who enjoys working with open source software. I'm able to leverage my experience working for customers, partners and vendors to provide a holistic view of technology and act as a trusted voice to prospects. I feel that industry outreach is the cornerstone of building strong product engagement. Here are some speaking and writing samples from the last few years:
